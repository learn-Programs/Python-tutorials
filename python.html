                        Python is an <strong>intepreted high-level object-oriented programming language which is easy to learn, powerful programming language written by Guido van Rossum in early 1990.</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Python features a dynamic type system and automatic memory management and supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented, imperative, functional programming, and procedural styles. It has a large and comprehensive standard library. Python has various features which we will learn in coming tutorial.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Python is most known for its elegant syntax and readable code. Python is simple to use, but it is a real programming language, offering much more structure and support for large programs than shell scripts or batch files can offer. Python provides <strong>more error checking </strong> than C, and being very high level language, it has high level data types built in, such as flexible arrays and dictionaries.

                   <p>
                        Python allows you to split your program into modules that can be reused in other Python programs. It comes with a large collection of standard modules that you can use as the basis of your programs.</p>	

                    <p>	
                		Program written in python are much shorter than other programming language like C, C++ or Java, because
                		
                		<li>High level datatypes which allow you to express complex operation in a single statement. </li>
                		<li>Python uses indentation for grouping statements or to specify block code instead of beginning and ending brackets.</li>
                		<li>In Python, there is no need to declare the variable or any argument before assigning the value into that. </li>
                   
                    <p>
                        By the way, the language is named after the BBC show <strong>Monty Python's Flying Circus</strong> and has nothing to do with reptiles.

                    <h3>History of Python</h3>

                <p>
                	Python was created in the early <strong>1990s</strong> by <strong>Guido van Rossum </strong> at Stichting Mathematisch Centrum in the Netherlands as a successor of a language called<strong> ABC</strong>. Guido remains Pythonâ€™s principal author, although it includes many contributions from others.
                	<br>
                	<br>

                	In <strong>1995</strong>, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for National Research Initiatives in Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the software.
                	<br>
                	In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to <strong>BeOpen.com </strong>to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team. In October of the same year, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations. In 2001, the Python Software Foundation was formed, a non-profit organization created specifically to own Python-related Intellectual Property. Zope Corporation is a sponsoring member of the PSF.
                	<br>
                	<br>

                	The first version of Python (<strong>Python 1.0</strong>) was introduced in <strong>1991</strong>. since introduction of version 1, the evolution of Python has reached up to version 3.x.
                	So, that is all about the history of Python. 
                	<br> 
                	In this article, we learned what is Python, and history of Python. 
                	In the next tutorial, The features of Python are explained, see you there!!
