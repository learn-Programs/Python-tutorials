                        Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. It has efficient high-level data structures and a simple but effective approach to object-oriented programming. Python's elegant syntax and dynamic typing, together with it's interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development in many areas on most platforms.
                    
                        There are many features of Python programming as follows making it more popular language
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <li><strong>Easy to learn</strong> : Python is easy to learn since it has simple, conventional syntax.
                        </li>
    
                        <li> <STRONG>Simplicity in coding</STRONG> : Simplicity is what isolates Python programming form other programming languages like C, C++, Java and others. Python is best for beginners as its simple and elegant syntax is easy to get along yet being so much powerful at the same time</li>
    
                        <li> <STRONG>Readable</STRONG> :  Reading a good, well-written Python program is as simple as a reading English.</li>
    
                        <li> <STRONG>Cross-platform language</STRONG> : Python is Cross-Platform language as Python is available and can run on various operating systems such as Mac, Windows, Linux, Unix, etc. </li>
    
                        <li> <STRONG>Free and Open Source</STRONG> : Python is constantly improved by the community of developers working every day to make it efficient and better. Python is Open Source programming language and it is free to download and use.</li>
    
                        <li> <STRONG>Large Standard Library</STRONG> : This is one of most reason why Python is most Popular language as Python provides a large standard library that has some modules and functions which we can use in our code.</li>
    
                        <li> <STRONG>Exception Handling</STRONG> : Python Supports exception handling, An exception is an event that can occur during program execution and can disrupt the normal flow of the program. Python supports exception handling which means we can write few errors code and can test various scenarios that can cause an exception later on. which is beacuase Python offers much more error checking than C.</li>
    
                        <li> <STRONG>Interpreted Language</STRONG> : Python is an  interpreted language, which can save your considerable time during program development because no compilation and linking is necessary.</li>
    
                        <li> <STRONG>Extensible</STRONG> : Python is extensible which means that the Python programs and applicaions can be used on multiple platforms with out any changes. </li>
    
                        <li> <STRONG>Automatic Memory Management</STRONG> :  Python supports automatic memory management which means the memory is cleared and freed automatically.</li>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        These are some features that makes Python versatile and most popular language amongs the developers and data scientists. Now, that you know why you should use Python, let's learn how to code in Python but before that, you should install Python on your machine which we going to learn in next tutorial.
