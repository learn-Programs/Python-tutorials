                        This is Beginner's guide to Python, you'll get an overview of the Python programming language. In this tutorial, you're going to learn to write computer programs in the Python programming language. 
                        You will learn to code while learning key Python concepts such as lists and for loops. You will learn how to create a variable and update variable. how to work with different kinds of data, how to manipulate Python dictionaries, and how to create functions and classes and, some advanced Python.
                    
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Python is a powerful programming language that you can do anything with. You can use it in machine learning technique to build predictive models, or you can use it in data analysis to analyse the data.
                        To begin your coding journey, you'll start with the basics of programming in Python. This Python tutorial provides basic and advanced concepts of Python. This is for both beginners and advanced Python learner. I recommand to practice the more examples to developed skills in coding.
                    </p>

                        But before we get into that, we need to know what exactly programming is. Programming is giving a set of instructions for a computer to follow. Now computers are really good in following this instructions very reliably and very quickly but not very creatively. And we can't just give computers instructions in English or any other natural language that we normally speak because natural language has ambiguity. words or sentences can have multiple meanings which computers can't figure out.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Instead we need to give a computers instructons in a <strong>programming language</strong>, which is a kind of language that computers can understand because they have a formal syntax or set of rules. All this instructions are collectively called <strong>code</strong>. and each line of instruction is known as a <strong>line of code</strong>. When we write a code, we program the computer to do some task. For this reason, we also called the code we write a <strong>computer program</strong> or a <strong>program</strong>. The program can be as small as one line. or can have multiple lines of code.
    
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The code we write serves as <strong>Input</strong> to the computer, and the result of excuting the code is called <strong>Output</strong>.
                        
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There are many programming languages that exist inculding Java, C, C++, R and many more.
                        But in this tutorial we're going to learn Python programming language.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now that you are all excited about Python, you'll want to examine it in some more details. Since the best way to learn a language is to use it, this tutorial invites you to play with the Python interpreter as you read.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The rest of the tutorial introduces various features of the Python language and through examples, beginning with simple expressions and statements and data types, through functions and modules, and finally touching advanced concepts like exceptions and user-defined classes.
    
                        So let's get started with <strong>Python</strong>.
